## Louise Ballantyne

In my quest to satisfy my previously unsated thirst for problem solving, I'm Learning to code with Makers - one of Europe's top Dev Bootcamps. During the 6 years I spent as a primary school teacher, I continuously strove to ignite the passion I have for STEM in young minds, despite battling a serious lack of resources, hardware so old it creaked and a tenuous internet connection. My natural pedantism meant that I never grew tired of picking up minor errors in pieces of writing, but also means that I am more likely to pick up minor errors in code - and less likely to make them in the first place. When teaching, my brain never quite felt that it got the workout it had grown accustomed to throughout my Physics degree, so I decided to take my career in a new direction, while maintaining my voluntary roles with Birdline (a Parrot Rescue Charity) as Area Co-ordinator and Rehoming Officer.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

My ability to problem solve was tested rigorously throughout my Physics degree. This was the case in both practical and theoretical work, for example in interpreting the difference between experimental and theoretical data of the intensity of a scattered X-ray beam, or simply determining why our experimental setup wasn't working. On occasion, we were also challenged to utilise programming languages, such as C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic, to retrieve and interpret input, for example from an analogue-digital converter.  On a different level, I more recently had to consider radical alternatives in order to teach a Computing curriculum with very limited hardware. To begin with, this was done with practical, unplugged exercises, teaching algorithmic thinking rather than just 'code'. Complementary to this, problem solving was at the heart of much of what was taught, with a celebration of different ways to approach each problem, however simple or complex. This novel approach means that I am more able to break problems down into simple steps, looking at them in a number of different ways in order to come up with a solution.

#### Assimilation and presentation of new concepts

Primary school teachers constantly have to teach themselves new concepts or new topics, ready to teach to eager, questioning minds. Whether the key achievements of Ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty or unfamiliar grammatical syntax such as the subjunctive form, it has to be understood and recalled sufficiently to withstand exhaustive questioning. This was also the case in my Physics degree: each week's laboratory work for the first two years would be on a different physical phenomenon and would require significant understanding and interpretation. This means I am able to quickly pick up new languages ready to pass on to others. It also means that I am well-practised in the presentation of new concepts, whether to young minds or to peers: as the computing subject head, I lead a number of staff meetings to teach tech concepts, such as algorithms, or to teach the use of new hardware to other teachers. 

#### Planning

More is achieved in a day which is time-managed and carefully planned. As an individual that thrives on meticulous structure in my daily life, I have always been a planner. This also extends to longer term planning - not just what I'll do in a day, but how I'll need to structure my training to achieve that half marathon goal in 4 months' time. As a teacher, I was responsible for breaking a larger goal from the curriculum down into a sequence, and determining if there was anything that needed to be in place before I could begin this sequence. Did the children have the foundations in the first place on which to build? Did I need to explain something in a few different ways before they would understand it? This is much like creating a program. What needs to be in place before I can begin to write this program? What classes and methods must be created? How can I do this in as terse a way as possible? Do I need to approach the problem from different directions in order to solve it? How can I achieve this in the most time-efficient way?
