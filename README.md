## Louise Ballantyne

In my quest to satisfy my previously unsated thirst for problem solving, I'm Learning to code with Makers - one of Europe's top Dev Bootcamps. During the 6 years I spent as a primary school teacher, I continuously strove to ignite the passion I have for STEM in young minds, despite battling a serious lack of resources, hardware so old it creaked and a tenuous internet connection. My natural pedantism meant that I never grew tired of picking up minor errors in pieces of writing, but also means that I am more likely to pick up minor errors in code - and less likely to make them in the first place. When teaching, my brain never quite felt that it got the workout it had grown accustomed to throughout my Physics degree, so I decided to take my career in a new direction, while maintaining my voluntary roles with Birdline (Parrot Rescue Charity) as Area Co-ordinator and Rehoming Officer.

#### Problem Solving

My ability to problem solve was tested rigorously throughout my Physics degree, in both practical and theoretical work. On occassion, we were also challenged to utilise programming languages, such as C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic, to retrieve input and manipulate data. On a different level, I had to think outside of the box in order to teach a computing curriculum with very limited hardware. To begin with, this was done with practical, unplugged exercises, teaching algorithmic thinking rather than just 'code'. 

#### Assimilation and presentation of new concepts

Primary school teachers constantly have to teach themselves new concepts or new topics, ready to teach to eager, questioning minds. Whether the key achievements of a dynasty or unfamiliar grammatical syntax, it has to be understood sufficiently to withstand exhaustive questioning. This enables me to quickly pick up new languages ready to pass on to others. It also means that I am well-practised in presenting new concepts to others, whether to younger minds or to peers: as the computing subject head, I lead a number of staff meetings to teach tech concepts or how to use new hardware to other teachers. 

#### Planning

As an individual that thrives on meticulous structure in my daily life, I have always been a planner. This also extends to longer term planning //// and what smaller goals will need to be met in order to achieve an overall goal. Teaching - curriculum. What spend more time on? What less? Running - what and when? Means that I am able to break a program down into smaller, manageable tasks and break a problem down. Plan how to complete a larger project.
